# Square Shape Detector
 This module takes clock (clk), reset (rst), x-coordinate (x), and y-coordinate (y) as inputs, and outputs square_detect_o, which indicates whether the given coordinates form a square. It utilizes shift registers to store the previous x and y coordinates and compares the current and previous coordinates to determine if they form a square shape. The width of the coordinates is set to 4 bits, allowing for four possible combinations: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1).
